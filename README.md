# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

## Step 1: Install Perspective
Ensure that Perspective is installed using the following command:
pip install perspective-python


## Step 2: Interface with Financial Data Feed
Modify the client.py script to fetch historical prices for two stocks. Create a function getHistoricalData that retrieves historical data points for a given stock from the financial data feed. The example assumes a simplified data format and fetches a predefined number of historical data points.

## Step 3: Calculate Correlation
Use NumPy to calculate the correlation coefficient between the historical prices of the two stocks. Install NumPy using:
pip install numpy
Create a function calculateCorrelation that takes two lists of historical prices and computes the correlation coefficient.

## Step 4: Visualize Using Perspective
Implement Perspective to visualize the historical data and correlation. Create a Perspective Table with relevant columns, add historical data to the table, and create a Viewer to visualize the data. Open the Perspective Viewer to visualize the historical prices and correlation between the two stocks.
